      <b>  A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans.[1] Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.</b></div>
<div class=" panel panel-default text-primary">
Because banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks. Most countries have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords.

<div class=" panel panel-default text-success">Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties — notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds — have played a central role over many centuries. The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472), while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590).</div>
<h4>Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)</h4>
<strong>
    A Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) is an integrated plan which offers life insurance cover and investment through a single scheme. Investment in ULIPs is tax deductible under Section 80 C up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum and the maturity proceeds of a ULIP are also exempt under Section 10(10)(D). ULIPs specify a life insurance cover (usually around 10 times your annual premium) and they allow you to choose ULIP funds which invest in equities and/or debt and function very similar to mutual funds. The minimum annual investment varies from fund to fund but is usually set at Rs 2,500. There is no maximum limit but tax deduction is only available for contributions up to Rs 1.5 lakh per year.

</strong>

<h4>Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)</h4>
<div class="container text-warning">
    ELSS or Equity Linked Savings Scheme is a type of mutual fund. ELSS Funds have a lock-in of 3 years, which is the shortest lock-in among the various tax-saving schemes in India. Investing in ELSS Funds (also called Tax Saving Funds) is tax deductible under Section 80 C up to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum. The returns on ELSS funds will be taxed as long term capital gains at a 10% rate. Dividends from ELSS funds will also be taxed at 10% under the Dividend Distribution Tax. ELSS funds invest at least 80% of their assets in equity (stocks) and offer a high compounding potential in the long term. You can know more about them here. The minimum annual investment in ELSS funds is Rs 100, although it varies from one fund to another. There is no maximum limit but tax deduction is only available for contributions up to Rs 1.5 lakh per year.

Tenure : 3 years (minimum), no maximum tenure
Minimum Investment: Rs 100. Different for different ELSS funds
Maximum Investment: None
Deduction on Principal: Yes
Tax on interest: Taxable at 10% (LTCG)
Government Savings Schemes
